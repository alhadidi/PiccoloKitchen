# Sensors-Visuals
Here we will include all the code aiming to show the data gathered from the Piccolo Kitchen project. 
The project consists of a transformable kitchen, using architectural robotics for a hyper-efficent use of space.
In a built prototype we include a wide range of sensors aiming to detect activity and study behavior in a new transformable enviroment.

The sensors included in the project and their codes are included in this other repository: https://github.com/agarciagoni/HomeData
